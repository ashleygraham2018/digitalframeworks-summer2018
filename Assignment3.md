The data set was actually pretty clean, so I didn't have to do too much to it.
1. I removed the Inspector Name column because there was no data in it, and I don't like to see blank spaces.
2. I replaced the blank cells in column H with "To be inspected" because the inspection orders had been placed in these instances, but the homes hadn't been inspected yet.
3. I replaced the blank cells in columns S, X, Y and AA with "N/A"
