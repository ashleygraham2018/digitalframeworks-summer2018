# Data set: Natural Hair in TV News

As natural hair becomes a more popular trend for Black women, I want to use data to see how much TV news stations are embracing it by hiring talent who wear their natural hair textures in their jobs as on-air reporters. I would survey TV stations in the top 50 Nielsen DMA markets. I will gather data from the stations' websites to see how well natural hair is represented in the nation's biggest cities.

## Here are some of the features I will collect for my data set:
	
  * Station name
  * DMA ranking
  * Number of Black female on-air talent
  * Number of Black females with natural hair
  * Region of the country
	
### Sample data set
