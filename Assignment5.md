I got the original data from this page: https://www.bls.gov/cps/demographics.htm#race
The data was already clean, so I didn't have to take any additional steps to organize it.

Questions
1.  Are fewer African Americans trying to work? A: Not necessarily. The participation rates are roughly the same across all three racial groups surveyed, so there's nothing to suggest that the unemployment rates are higher for African Americans because they're choosing not to participate.
2.  What does the data say about Asians in the workforce? A: The number of employed Asians rose the least between 2016-2017. But Asians make up a significantly smaller portion of the population compared to whites and African Americans, and they had a lower unemployment rate than African Americans in both years.
3.  Are things looking up for women over age 20? A: Yes, especially for black and Asian women. They experienced a percent change in employment around 3%, compared to 0.77% for white women over age 20.

The unemployment rate for African Americans was nearly double that of white and Asian workers in 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Black women aged 16 and over were more likely to employed than their male counterparts, but were still unemployed at nearly double the rate of white workers in the same age group. But all races had roughly the same participation rate in the work force in 2017.
