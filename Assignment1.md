### Journalism is bad for your health
Specifically, there is data to suggest that journalists have a higher tendency to experience mental health issues as a result of their work, especially if they are constantly covering traumatic events. We joke about newsrooms having lots of unhealthy foods and not having time to do anything except collapse on the couch when we get home, knocking out the possibility of healthier habits like exercise. I want to see if there is more data on physical health of journalists compared to people who work in other careers, and I also want to tie in mental health and how that affects physical health

1. The cited data in this piece is a little older (from 2014), but the piece is still strong and relevant to my chosen topic. 2. I was able to figure out that it would be about the toll reporting can take on mental health. I give it a 5 for clarity, espeically with the headline. 
3. I give it a 4 for navigation, only because I would've preferred links to the data the author used. 
4. The data itself is accurate and well-sourced so I give that a 5, especially because the author makes clear where there was too little research done to yield specific results. 
5. Visually it gets a 1, since there was no visual representation of the data.
6. Quality: 4.
