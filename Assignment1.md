### Journalism is bad for your health
Specifically, there is data to suggest that journalists have a higher tendency to experience mental health issues as a result of their work, especially if they are constantly covering traumatic events. We joke about newsrooms having lots of unhealthy foods and not having time to do anything except collapse on the couch when we get home, knocking out the possibility of healthier habits like exercise. I want to see if there is more data on physical health of journalists compared to people who work in other careers, and I also want to tie in mental health and how that affects physical health.

1. The cited data in this piece is a little older (from 2014), but the piece is still strong and relevant to my chosen topic. 2. I was able to figure out that it would be about the toll reporting can take on mental health. I give it a 5 for clarity, espeically with the headline. 
3. I give it a 4 for navigation, only because I would've preferred links to the data the author used. 
4. The data itself is accurate and well-sourced so I give that a 5, especially because the author makes clear where there was too little research done to yield specific results. 
5. Visually it gets a 1, since there was no visual representation of the data.
6. Quality: 4. 

### Legacy students in college admissions
With the Trump administration pushing for an end to affirmative-action practices in college admissions that have leveled the playing field for decades, many people focus on race as the primary demographic in college admissions. And while I do see race as an important factor in college admissions, I want to take a look at the stats on legacy admissions and analyze how important of a factor it has been in college admissions practices around the country. I have a feeling that more data will be published in the coming weeks, as colleges and universities gear up for the next round of admissions for the new class.

1. The article gets a 5 for clarity and breaking down the data (from multiple sources) into digestible chunks.
2. I believe the quality of the report is a 5 as well. 
3. There were no visualizations in this piece, so I can't score it for color and type. I think it would be interesting to see bar graphs or charts with the median scores of legacy vs. non-legacy applicants on standardized entrance exams like the SAT or ACT.
4. I give the piece a 2 for creativity. It was very matter-of-fact, and I would've liked to see at least one anecdote from a high school student (or their parent) discussing the application process, or recent high-school graduates discussing how many legacy classmates they had and how they felt about the process.
