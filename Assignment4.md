Final project pitch

I want to use data to see which news stations have the most representation of natural hair in their on-air talent, specifically with Black female reporters. I want to examine the top 50 news markets (according to Nielsen rankings) for the following data:
  1. Racial demographics of the city
  2. Station name
  3. Region of the country
  4. Number of Black female on-air talent
  5. Number of Black female on-air talent with natural hair
  6. Station's DMA ranking
  
I could visualize the data using scatter plot graphs and a map of the United States that shows higher concentrations of natural on-air reporters.
The story is timely because there is a growing interest in diversifying on-air talent teams. Natural hair is a growing trend among Black women and is slowly becoming more prominent in newsrooms.
I plan on getting data directly from TV news station websites. I could also reach out to news directors who have hired women with natural hair, as well as reporters and anchors who regularly wear their natural hair on the job.
